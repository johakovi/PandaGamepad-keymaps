# Panda Gamepad Pro keymapping for Samsung Galaxy Fold 6
There is various onscreen keymaps for Fold 6 (or maybe for too 2160x1856 screens and 20.9:18 aspect ratios?) that uses [Panda Gamepad Pro app](https://pandagame.app/).
These are my ready to go settings that you can [import](#import) in Panda's app

_Games:_

- [Arena Breakout](#arena-breakout)
- [Aporcalypse](#aporcalypse)
- [Hill Climb Racing](#hill-climb-racing)
- [Crazy Taxi Classic](#crazy-taxi-classic)
- [a2481](#a2481)
- [Death Worm Deluxe](#death-worm-deluxe)
- [Genshin Impact](#genshin-impact)
- [JetCarStunt 2](#jetcarstunt-2)
- [Shell Racing](#shell-racing)
- [Payback 2](#payback-2)
- [Morphite](#morphite)
- [EKA2L1 (Emulator)](#eka2l1)

If you want to use some of this keymaps in other game, then change "pkgname" in xxx.json file via text editor to your preferred app.
Example: ,"pkgName":"com.crescentmoongames.morphite","

There should be in all of this keymaps _layout changer_ and it's button is "mode" button.

Panda's ui _hiding_ button is "left joystick" + "start"

_Happy gaming!_ ðŸŽ®
